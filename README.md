# Nine Circ-le
A Geometry Dash -le game inspired by Balatrodle where you have to guess the randomly chosen Nine Circles clone of the day.

Created by redstone59 (idea, backend) and [Yanqui](https://github.com/yanqui-uxo) (frontend),
with special thanks to [Gaster319](https://twitter.com/gaster319) and [Dreaming](https://github.com/dreaming98) for compiling a list of Nine Circles levels, based on [this list](https://geometry-dash-fan.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Nine_Circles_levels).
