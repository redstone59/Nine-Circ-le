A Geometry Dash -le game, inspired by [Balatrodle](https://www.balatrodle.com/), where you have to guess the randomly chosen Nine Circles clone of the day.

Created by redstone59 (idea, backend) and [Yanqui](https://github.com/yanqui-uxo) (frontend),
with special thanks to [shikoshib](https://github.com/shikoshib) for creating the [gj-boomlings-api](https://github.com/shikoshib/gj-boomlings-api) used in the game, along with [Gaster319](https://twitter.com/gaster319) and [Dreaming](https://github.com/dreaming98) for compiling a list of Nine Circles levels, based on [this list](https://geometry-dash-fan.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Nine_Circles_levels).
