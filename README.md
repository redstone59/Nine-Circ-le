# Nine Circ-le
A Geometry Dash -le game, inspired by [Balatrodle](https://www.balatrodle.com/), where you have to guess the randomly chosen Nine Circles clone of the day.

Created by redstone59 (idea, backend) and [Yanqui](https://github.com/yanqui-uxo) (frontend),
with special thanks to [cdc-sys](https://github.com/cdc-sys/) for compiling level thumbnails for their [Geometry Dash mod](https://github.com/cdc-sys/level-thumbnails), and [Gaster319](https://twitter.com/gaster319) and [Dreaming](https://github.com/dreaming98) for compiling a list of Nine Circles levels, based on [this list](https://geometry-dash-fan.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Nine_Circles_levels).
